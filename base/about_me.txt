Hello, my name is Salvatore Giambrone and this is my second semester at IUPUI. My major is in computer science and I am planing on minoring in math. From freshmen to seinor year in highschool I was in computer science clases and it was in these classes where my favorite memories were made. I am in this class because it will help me further my programing knowledge and to achieve my goal of becoming a software develpoer.
